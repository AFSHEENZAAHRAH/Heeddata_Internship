resources bandwidth are divided into pieces and bit delay is constant during a connection  the dedicated pathcircuit established between sender and receiver provides a guaranteed data rate  data can be transmitted without any delays once the circuit is established  telephone system network is one of the example of circuit switching  two methods of multiplexing multiple signals into a single carrier  tdm time division multiplexing  fdm frequency division multiplexing circuit switching circuit switching  frequency division multiplexing  divides into multiple bands frequency division multiplexing or fdm is used when multiple data signals are combined for simultaneous transmission via a shared communication medium  it is a technique by which the total bandwidth is divided into a series of nonoverlapping frequency subbands where each subband carry different signal  practical use in radio spectrum  optical fiber to share multiple independent signals circuit switching  frequency division multiplexing circuit switching  time division multiplexing  divides into frames with respect to time timedivision multiplexing tdm is a method of transmitting and receiving independent signals over a common signal path by means of synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line  tdm is used for longdistance communication links and bears heavy data traffic loads from end user  time division multiplexing tdm is also known as a digital circuit switched circuit switching circuit switching variants  the following variants on tdm are as follows   atdm asynchronous time division multiplexing multiplexing in which the data is transmitted asynchronously  stdm statistical time division multiplexing a multiplexing method that polls nodes and immediately skips any nodes with nothing to send  stm synchronous transfer node designer for use in bisdn broadband isdn and also supported in the sonet asynchronous optical network architecture circuit switching advantages of circuit switching 1the main advantage of circuit switching is that a committed transmission channel is established between the computers which give a guaranteed data rate 2incircuit switching there is no delay in data flow because of the dedicated transmission path disadvantages of circuit switching 1it takes a long time to establish a connection 2more bandwidth is required in setting up dedicated channels 3it cannot be used to transmit any other data even if the channel is free as the connection is dedicated to circuit switching packet switching  packet switching is a method of transferring the data to a network in form of packets  in order to transfer the file fast and efficiently manner over the network and minimize the transmission latency the data is broken into small pieces of variable length called packet  at the destination all these small parts packets have to be reassembled belonging to the same file  a packet composes of payload and various control information no presetup or reservation of resources is needed packet switching  packet switching uses store and forward technique while switching the packets while forwarding the packet each hop first stores that packet then forward  packets belonging to the same file may or may not travel through the same path if there is congestion at some path packets are allowed to choose different paths possible over an existing network  packetswitched networks were designed to overcome the weaknesses of circuitswitched networks since circuit switched networks were not very effective for small messages packet switching  advantage of packet switching over circuit switching   more efficient in terms of bandwidth since the concept of reserving circuit is not there  minimal transmission latency  more reliable as a destination can detect the missing packet  more fault tolerant because packets may follow a different path in case any link is down unlike circuit switching  costeffective and comparatively cheaper to implement packet switching  the disadvantage of packet switching over circuit switching   packet switching doesnt give packets in order whereas circuit switching provides ordered delivery of packets because all the packets follow the same path  since the packets are unordered we need to provide sequence numbers for each packet  complexity is more at each node because of the facility to follow multiple paths  transmission delay is more because of rerouting  packet switching is beneficial only for small messages but for bursty data large messages circuit switching is better packet switching  modes of packet switching   1 connectionoriented packet switching virtual circuit  before starting the transmission it establishes a logical path or virtual connection using signaling protocol between sender and receiver and all packets belongs to this flow will follow this predefined route  virtual circuit id is provided by switchesrouters to uniquely identify this virtual connection  data is divided into small units and all these small units are appended with help of sequence numbers  overall three phases take place here the setup data transfer and tear down phase packet switching  all address information is only transferred during the setup phase  once the route to a destination is discovered entry is added to the switching table of each intermediate node  during data transfer packet header local header may contain information such as length timestamp sequence number etc  connectionoriented switching is very useful in switched wan  some popular protocols which use the virtual circuit switching approach are x25 framerelay atm and mplsmultiprotocol label switching packet switching  modes of packet switching   2 connectionless packet switching datagram  unlike connectionoriented packet switching in connectionless packet switching each packet contains all necessary addressing information such as source address destination address and port numbers etc  in datagram packet switching each packet is treated independently  packets belonging to one flow may take different routes because routing decisions are made dynamically so the packets arrived at the destination might be out of order  it has no connection setup and teardown phase like virtual circuits  packet delivery is not guaranteed in connectionless packet switching so reliable delivery must be provided by end systems using additional protocols packet switching packet switching delays in packet switching  1transmission delay 2propagation delay 3queuing delay 4processing delay bridges and lan switches sno switch bridge 1 it is a device which is responsible for channeling the data that is coming into the various input ports to a particular output port which will further take the data to the desired destination it is basically a device which is responsible for dividing a single network into various network segments 2 a switch can have a lot of ports a bridge can have 2 or 4 ports only 3 the switch performs the packet forwarding by using hardwares such as asics hence it is hardware based the bridge performs the packet forwarding by using softwares so it is software based 4 the switching method in case of a switch can thus be store forward fragment free or cut through the switching method in case of a bridge is store and forward 5 the task of error checking is performed by a switch a bridge cannot perform the error checking 6 a switch has buffers a bridge may not have a buffer spanning tree algorithm  spanning tree protocol stp is a communication protocol operating at data link layer the osi model to prevent bridge loops and the resulting broadcast storms  it creates a loop free topology for ethernet networks  a bridge loop is created when there are more than one paths between two nodes in a given network  when a message is sent particularly when a broadcast is done the bridges repeatedly rebroadcast the same message flooding the network  since a data link layer frame does not have a timetolive field in the header the broadcast frame may loop forever thus swamping the channels spanning tree algorithm  spanning tree protocol creates a spanning tree by disabling all links that form a loop or cycle in the network  this leaves exactly one active path between any two nodes of the network  so when a message is broadcast there is no way that the same message can be received from an alternate path  the bridges that participate in spanning tree protocol are often called spanning tree bridges  to construct a spanning tree the bridges broadcast their configuration routes spanning tree algorithm  then they execute a distributed algorithm for finding out the minimal spanning tree in the network ie the spanning tree with minimal cost  the links not included in this tree are disabled but not removed  in case a particular active link fails the algorithm is executed again to find the minimal spanning tree without the failed link  the communication continues through the newly formed spanning tree  when a failed link is restored the algorithm is rerun including the newly restored link spanning tree algorithm ipv4  ip stands for internet protocol and v4 stands for version four ipv4  ipv4 was the primary version brought into action for production within the arpanet in 1983  ip version four addresses are 32bit integers which will be expressed in decimal notation example 19202126 could be an ipv4 address ipv4parts  network part the network part indicates the distinctive variety thats appointed to the network the network part conjointly identifies the category of the network thats assigned  host part the host part uniquely identifies the machine on your network this part of the ipv4 address is assigned to every host for each host on the network the network part is the same however the host half must vary  subnet number this is the nonobligatory part of ipv4 local networks that have massive numbers of hosts are divided into subnets and subnet numbers are appointed to that ipv4characteristics ipv4 could be a 32bit ip address ipv4 could be a numeric address and its bits are separated by a dot the number of header fields is twelve and the length of the header field is twenty it has unicast broadcast and multicast style of addresses ipv4 supports vlsm virtual length subnet mask ipv4 uses the post address resolution protocol to map to the mac address rip may be a routing protocol supported by the routed daemon networks ought to be designed either manually or with dhcp packet fragmentation permits from routers and causing host ipv4advantages ipv4 security permits encryption to keep up privacy and security ipv4 network allocation is significant and presently has quite 85000 practical routers it becomes easy to attach multiple devices across an outsized network while not nat this is a model of communication so provides quality service also as economical knowledge transfer subnetting  when a bigger network is divided into smaller networks in order to maintain security then that is known as subnetting  so maintenance is easier for smaller networks it is a class c ip so there are 24 bits in the network id part and 8 bits in the host id part subnetting for subnet1 the first bit which is chosen from the host id part is zero and the range will be from 1931200000000 till you get all 1s in the host id part ie 1931201111111 except for the first bit which is chosen zero for subnet id part thus the range of subnet1 193120 to 19312127 subnetting for subnet1 the first bit which is chosen from the host id part is zero and the range will be from 1931200000000 till you get all 1s in the host id part ie 1931201111111 except for the first bit which is chosen zero for subnet id part thus the range of subnet1 193120 to 19312127 for subnet2 the first bit chosen from the host id part is one and the range will be from 19312100000000 till you get all 1s in the host id part ie 1931211111111 thus the range of subnet2 19312128 to 19312255 subnetting now that we know about what is ipv6 address lets take a look at its different types unicast addresses it identifies a unique node on a network and usually refers to a single sender or a single receiver multicast addresses it represents a group of ip devices and can only be used as the destination of a datagram anycast addresses it is assigned to a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes subnetting to divide a network into four 22 parts you need to choose two bits from host id part for each subnet ie 00 01 10 11 to divide a network into eight 23 parts you need to choose three bits from host id part for each subnet ie 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 and so on ipv6 now that we know about what is ipv6 address lets take a look at its different types unicast addresses it identifies a unique node on a network and usually refers to a single sender or a single receiver multicast addresses it represents a group of ip devices and can only be used as the destination of a datagram anycast addresses it is assigned to a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes ipv6 reliability faster speeds ipv6 supports multicast rather than broadcast in ipv4this feature allows bandwidthintensive packet flows like multimedia streams to be sent to multiple destinations all at once stringer security ipsecurity which provides confidentiality and data integrity is embedded into ipv6 routing efficiency most importantly its the final solution for growing nodes in globalnetwork conversion due to widespread present usage of ipv4 it will take a long period to completely shift to ipv6 communication ipv4 and ipv6 machines cannot communicate directly with each other they need an intermediate technology to make that possible ipv6 routingtechniques distancevectorrip linkstateospf inter domain routing bgp routingtechniques distancevectorrip linkstateospf inter domain routing bgp ipv6 routingtechniques distancevectorrip routing information protocol rip is a dynamic routing protocol that uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network  hop count is the number of routers occurring in between the source and destination network  the path with the lowest hop count is considered as the best route to reach a network and therefore placed in the routing table features of rip 1 updates of the network are exchanged periodically 2 updates routing information are always broadcast 3 full routing tables are sent in updates 4 routers always trust routing information received from neighbor routers this is also known as routing on rumors ipv6 routingtechniques distancevectorrip rip v1 is known as classful routing protocol because it doesnt send information of subnet mask in its routing update rip v2 is known as classless routing protocol because it sends information of subnet mask in its routing update advantages of rip  simplicity rip is a relatively simple protocol to configure and manage making it an ideal choice for small to mediumsized networks with limited resources easy implementation rip is easy to implement as it does not require much technical expertise to set up and maintain convergence rip is known for its fast convergence time meaning that it can quickly adapt to changes in network topology and route packets efficiently automatic updates rip automatically updates routing tables at regular intervals ensuring that the most uptodate information is being used to route packets low bandwidth overhead rip uses a relatively low amount of bandwidth to exchange routing information making it an ideal choice for networks with limited bandwidth ipv6 routingtechniques distancevectorrip disadvantages of rip  limited scalability rip has limited scalability and it may not be the best choice for larger networks with complex topologies rip can only support up to 15 hops which may not be sufficient for larger networks slow convergence while rip is known for its fast convergence time it can be slower to converge than other routing protocols this can lead to delays and inefficiencies in network performance routing loops rip can sometimes create routing loops which can cause network congestion and reduce overall network performance ipv6 routingtechniques linkstateospf open shortest path first ospf is a linkstate routing protocol that is used to find the best path between the source and the destination router using its own shortest path first ospf terms 1router id  it is the highest active ip address present on the router first the highest loopback address is considered if no loopback is configured then the highest active ip address on the interface of the router is considered 2router priority  it is an 8bit value assigned to a router operating ospf used to elect dr and bdr in a broadcast network 3designated router dr  it is elected to minimize the number of adjacencies formed dr distributes the lsas to all the other routers dr is elected in a broadcast network to which all the other routers share their dbd in a broadcast network the router requests for an update to dr and dr will respond to that request with an update 4backup designated router bdr  bdr is a backup to dr in a broadcast network when dr goes down bdr becomes dr and performs its functions 5dr and bdr election  dr and bdr election takes place in the broadcast network or multiaccess network ipv6 routingtechniques linkstateospf ospf states

standard it is a standard protocol which can run on any window device exterior gateway protocol it is an exterior gateway protocol that is used to exchange the routing information between two or more
